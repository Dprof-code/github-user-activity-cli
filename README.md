# Github Activity CLI 💻

## Overview

Github Activity CLI is a lightweight and efficient command-line tool designed for developers who want to track GitHub user contributions without leaving the terminal. Built with **Node.js**, it fetches real-time data from the GitHub API and provides a clean, summarized view of recent activities, including commits, issues, and repository stars.

## Features

- **Activity Aggregation**: Intelligently groups multiple commits under the same repository for a cleaner output.
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches the latest event data directly from the GitHub REST API.
- **Event Parsing**: Distinctly identifies different event types like `PushEvent`, `WatchEvent`, and more.
- **Minimalist Design**: Zero-bloat CLI interface focused on speed and readability.
